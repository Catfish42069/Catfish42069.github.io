      <dd><br>It is one of the greatest, if not <strong>THE GREATEST</strong> aquatic species.</dd><br>
      <dt>Okay, but what about it?</dt>
      <dd><br>Catfish, a diverse group of freshwater fish with over 3,000 species, feature whisker-like<br> 
        barbels for navigation, are predominantly bottom-dwellers, and have a diet ranging from <br>
        insects to aquatic plants. They lack scales, come in various sizes, and exhibit unique<br>
         breeding behaviors. The largest recorded catfish weighs over 646 pounds, and they're<br> 
         economically significant for human consumption. Some can produce electric shocks for<br>
          navigation, but many face conservation challenges due to habitat loss and pollution,<br>
           highlighting their ecological importance.</dd>
