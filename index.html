      <dt>Okay, but what about it?</dt>
      <dd><br style="text-align: justify;">Catfish, a diverse group of freshwater fish with over 3,000 species, feature whisker-like
        barbels for navigation, are predominantly bottom-dwellers, and have a diet ranging from 
        insects to aquatic plants. They lack scales, come in various sizes, and exhibit unique
         breeding behaviors. The largest recorded catfish weighs over 646 pounds, and they're
         economically significant for human consumption. Some can produce electric shocks for
          navigation, but many face conservation challenges due to habitat loss and pollution,
           highlighting their ecological importance.</dd>
