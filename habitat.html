        <img src="habitat.jpg" length="200" width="200">
        <p>Catfish are a highly adaptable species found in a wide range of aquatic habitats worldwide.<br>
             They thrive in freshwater environments, including rivers, lakes, ponds, and swamps. Their<br>
             habitat preference can vary depending on the specific species, but most catfish are bottom-dwellers,<br>
              making them well-suited to muddy or sandy substrates. Many species prefer slow-moving or still waters <br>
              with plenty of hiding spots like submerged logs, rocks, and vegetation. Catfish are known for their nocturnal <br>
              behavior, often venturing out to feed during the cover of darkness. Their ability to live in diverse<br>
              habitats and adapt to changing environmental conditions contributes to their success as a species.<br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>
