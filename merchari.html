      <p class="letter-content">
        I know I won't be the only one saying this, but thank you for being such a great teacher the past 2 quarters and a half. (You were great before too, I'm just saying I've felt your impact much more with you as our advisor as compared to the past T.T ) It's hard to believe that my time at DGCS is coming to an end after so long, but I can proudly say that I learned a lotâ€”both as a student, and as a person. Thank you for being the person the class could open up to, someone everyone seems to rely on. I also heard that you encouraged Blessie to give me that letter, as weird as the situation is, being able to speak out about what's happened, and how I've felt with everything. I've gotten a lot of clarity, regarding Caitlyn, Blessie and whatnot. It means a lot to have someone to talk to, even if I don't do much talking. I really do appreciate everything you do as a teacher, and I promise, that everything that you've done for me won't go to waste. I onced looked up to Seifer for his qualities and capabilities, but you've portrayed someone who goes above and beyond that. Not sure how to end this, so have a Merry Christmas(?)
